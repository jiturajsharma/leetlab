## Step-by-Step Guide to Install Judge0 CE on Windows

### Step 1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
WSL allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, which is necessary for installing Judge0 since it is optimized for Linux.

1. **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator**:
   - Right-click the Start menu, select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Command Prompt (Admin)," and click "Yes" to allow changes.

2. **Install WSL and Ubuntu**:
   - Run the following command to install WSL with the default Ubuntu distribution:
     ```bash
     wsl --install
     ```
   - This command enables WSL, installs WSL 2, and sets up the Ubuntu distribution (default). If you already have WSL installed, this command will display help text.
   - If you see help text, check available distributions with:
     ```bash
     wsl --list --online
     ```
     Install Ubuntu explicitly if needed:
     ```bash
     wsl --install -d Ubuntu
     ```

3. **Restart Your Computer**:
   - After the installation completes, restart your machine to apply changes.

4. **Set Up Ubuntu**:
   - After restarting, open the Start menu and launch "Ubuntu" (or run `wsl` in a terminal).
   - The first time you launch Ubuntu, it will set up the distribution. You’ll be prompted to create a username and password for your Linux user account. Note these down as you’ll need them later.

5. **Verify WSL Installation**:
   - In the Ubuntu terminal, run:
     ```bash
     wsl -l -v
     ```
   - Ensure your Ubuntu distribution is set to WSL 2 (not WSL 1). If it’s WSL 1, convert it to WSL 2:
     ```bash
     wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
     ```

6. **Update Ubuntu**:
   - Update the package lists and upgrade installed packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

---

### Step 2: Install Docker on WSL
Docker is required to run Judge0 CE as it uses Docker containers for its services.

1. **Install Docker in Ubuntu**:
   - In the Ubuntu terminal (WSL), install Docker by following these commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install -y docker.io
     ```
   - Start the Docker service and enable it to run on boot:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start docker
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     ```

2. **Add Your User to the Docker Group**:
   - To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the Docker group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```
   - Log out and back into the Ubuntu terminal (or restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell and reopen Ubuntu) for the group change to take effect.

3. **Install Docker Compose**:
   - Judge0 uses Docker Compose to manage its services. Install it with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install -y docker-compose
     ```

4. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   - Check that Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     docker-compose --version
     ```

---

### Step 3: Download and Set Up Judge0 CE
Judge0 CE is distributed as a ZIP file containing configuration and Docker Compose files.

1. **Download Judge0 CE**:
   - In the Ubuntu terminal, download the Judge0 CE v1.13.1 release:
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/judge0/judge0/releases/download/v1.13.1/judge0-v1.13.1.zip
     ```

2. **Unzip the File**:
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file:
     ```bash
     unzip judge0-v1.13.1.zip
     ```
   - This creates a folder named `judge0-v1.13.1`.

3. **Navigate to the Judge0 Directory**:
   - List the contents to confirm the folder exists:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - Move into the `judge0-v1.13.1` directory:
     ```bash
     cd judge0-v1.13.1
     ```
   - List the contents to verify the files:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - You should see files like `docker-compose.yml`, `judge0.conf`, and others.

---

### Step 4: Configure Judge0 CE
Judge0 requires configuration for services like Redis and PostgreSQL, including setting passwords.

1. **Generate Random Passwords**:
   - The Judge0 documentation recommends generating secure passwords for Redis and PostgreSQL. You can create random passwords using a command like:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -base64 12
     ```
   - Run this command twice to generate two passwords (one for Redis, one for PostgreSQL). Save these passwords securely, as you’ll need them in the next step.
   - Example output:
     ```
     Xyz123abc456
     Pqr789def012
     ```

2. **Edit the Configuration File**:
   - Open the `judge0.conf` file using the `nano` text editor:
     ```bash
     nano judge0.conf
     ```
   - Scroll to find the `REDIS_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` fields:
     - For `REDIS_PASSWORD`, paste the first generated password.
     - For `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, paste the second generated password.
   - Example:
     ```conf
     REDIS_PASSWORD=Xyz123abc456
     POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Pqr789def012
     ```
   - Save the file by pressing `Ctrl+O`, then press `Enter` to write the changes.
   - Exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl+X`.

3. **Verify You’re in the Correct Directory**:
   - Ensure you’re still in the `judge0-v1.13.1` directory:
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - You should see `judge0.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.

---

### Step 5: Start Judge0 Services
Judge0 uses Docker Compose to run its services (database, Redis, server, and worker).

1. **Start Database and Redis**:
   - Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database and Redis services in the background:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d db redis
     ```

2. **Wait for Services to Initialize**:
   - Pause for 10 seconds to ensure the database and Redis are fully up:
     ```bash
     sleep 10
     ```

3. **Start All Judge0 Services**:
   - Start the remaining services (server and worker):
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - This command launches the Judge0 server and worker containers. The `-d` flag runs them in the background.

4. **Verify Services Are Running**:
   - Check the status of the containers:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```
   - You should see containers for `judge0-server`, `judge0-worker`, `judge0-db`, and `judge0-redis` running.

---

### Step 6: Access Judge0 CE
Once the services are running, you can access the Judge0 web interface and verify its functionality.

1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open a web browser on your Windows machine and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:2358
     ```
   - This is the default port for the Judge0 web interface.

2. **Check Health Status**:
   - Verify that Judge0 is running correctly by visiting:
     ```
     http://localhost:2358/health
     ```
   - You should see a status indicating the system is operational.

---

### Step 7: Troubleshooting and Additional Notes
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Docker not starting**: Ensure Docker is running in your WSL environment (`sudo systemctl start docker`).
  - **Port conflicts**: If port 2358 is in use, edit `docker-compose.yml` to change the port mapping (e.g., `2359:2358`).
  - **Permission errors**: Ensure your user is in the Docker group (Step 2.2).

- **Stopping Judge0**:
  - To stop all Judge0 services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

- **Accessing Logs**:
  - View logs for debugging:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```

- **Official Documentation**:
  - Refer to the [Judge0 CE GitHub repository](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) and [API documentation](https://ce.judge0.com) for additional configuration options and API usage.

- **Drive Access**:
  - WSL mounts Windows drives under `/mnt` (e.g., `C:` is `/mnt/c`, `D:` is `/mnt/d`). You can navigate to any drive in the Ubuntu terminal:
    ```bath
    cd /mnt/c
    ```
  - Perform the installation steps in any directory, such as `/mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/judge0` or your home directory (`~`).

---

### Step 8: Optional Enhancements
- **Auto-Start Docker**:
  - To ensure Docker starts automatically in WSL, configure it in your `~/.bashrc`:
    ```bash
    echo "sudo systemctl start docker" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

- **Customizing Judge0**:
  - Edit `judge0.conf` to adjust runtime constraints (e.g., CPU time, memory limits) as per the [Judge0 documentation](https://ce.judge0.com).

- **Using Judge0 API**:
  - After installation, you can interact with Judge0 via its REST API. For example, submit code for execution using `curl` or a programming language like Python.
